  <h1 id="title">Chhath Puja </h1>
  <p>India is a land of festivals that are celebrated throughout the year in different corners of the country with joy and enthusiasm. One of the most important festivals celebrated just after a week of Diwali is Chhath Puja. Chhath Puja is a festival devoted to Sun God Surya and his wife Usha, who is also known as Chhathi Maiya. During Chhath Puja, people thank Lord Surya, the god of energy and life-force for sustaining the life of Earth. Devotees believe that the Sun is also a source of healing and helps to cure many illnesses and diseases.

The word “Chhath” translates to sixth in Bhojpuri, Maithili and Nepali dialects. The festival is celebrated on the 6th day of the Kartikeya month of the Hindu calendar and hence is known as the Chhath Puja. According to the English Calendar, it falls in the month of October or November. This festival lasts for 4 days, which makes it the longest festival after Navratis.</p>
